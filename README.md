## Description

Rostar is a command-line tool that extracts Roblox place files (`rbxl`/`rbxlx`) into model files and `.lua` scripts in the filesystem, for use with [Rojo](https://rojo.space/). It is useful to both developers that prefer Roblox Studio, but also to Rojo users that would like a fully managed workflow without a hassle.
