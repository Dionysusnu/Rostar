title: Rojo-first workflow

A Rojo-first workflow presumes using the filesystem as the source of truth for code (`.lua` files), and using Studio as the source for models and related instances.

To achieve this, the following constraints must be ensured:

- The project file must not be overwritten
- Source files must not be overwritten

So, to use Rostar in this way — only extracting models — the tool can be run using the following parameters:

```sh
rostar unpack PlaceFile.rbxl --no-overwrite-project --no-lua --assets-directory assets
```

This command configuration will use another directory for models, and will keep the existing source files intact.

### Caveats

The existing project file will have to be modified to use the extracted asset files. Each service will have to be marked inside the project file, and their children and/or some descendants will have to be explicitly written, too.

A way around this is running Rostar for the initial generation of the project file, and then adjusting the directories for the source code accordingly.
