# Tooling setup

## Getting the npm package

To install Rostar, make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is set up. After that, it can installed by getting the [`rostar`](https://npmjs.com/package/rostar) package:

```bash
npm install -g rostar
```

Running the command with the `-g` argument is recommended, and allows you to run `rostar` from any location in your console.

## Installing Rojo and Remodel

It is recommended to use [Foreman](https://github.com/Roblox/foreman) for managing Rostar's required tools - [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) and [Remodel](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/remodel). Foreman can be installed through [cargo](https://crates.io/crates/foreman) or by getting the binary files inside your system PATH.

:::note
Foreman may be replaced by [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman) in the future.
