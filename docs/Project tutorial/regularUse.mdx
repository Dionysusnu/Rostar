# Regular use

The regular work cycle in a fully managed Rojo project generally involves the following steps:

1. Save the place file
2. Unpack the place file into different models
3. Build or serve the place file with Rojo
4. Repeat

With Rostar, this process is the same, but is much simpler to execute.

## Extracting instances from a place

To extract models and/or scripts from a place file, the following command is used:

```bash
rostar unpack ./Path_To_Place_File.rbxl
```

By default, the unpack command generates a folder structure that tries to replicate the structure of the Roblox DataModel. There are two folders - one for scripts and one for model files:

```
assets/
	Workspace/
		SomeFolder/
			AnotherFolder/
				ModelA.rbxm
				ModelB.rbxm
	ServerStorage/
		SomeModel.rbxm
	...

DataModel/
	ServerScriptService/
		Code/
			init.server.lua
			someModule.lua
	ReplicatedStorage/
		Shared/
			someModule.lua
	ServerStorage/
		someModule.lua
	...
```

:::tip
By using `--assets-directory DataModel` as an argument to the command, scripts and model files can be in the same base directory.
:::

### Extracting models only

```bash
rostar unpack ./Path_To_Place_File.rbxl --no-lua
```

If Rostar is only used for extracting models, `--no-overwrite-project-file` should be used as well for preserving the existing script paths. Edits to the project file might be needed if new directories are added.

### Extracting scripts only

```bash
rostar unpack ./Path_To_Place_File.rbxl --no-models
```

## Building the place file

The place file can be generated by running:

```bash
rostar pack OutputPlaceFile.rbxl
```

:::tip

`rostar pack` can be run by itself if a file named after the `name` property from the project file should be outputted.

:::

This is virtually equivalent to running:

```bash
rojo build --output OutputPlaceFile.rbxl
```
